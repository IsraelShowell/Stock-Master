# Project: Inventory Management - Login Backend
# Version: 1.30

# Description:
This repository hosts the Back-End of the account creation, login, and dashboard functionality of the Inventory Management software.
This project was designed for a Hackathon hosted by Headstarter AI! Israel developed the Back-End and the basic UI using Python, SQLite, Flask, and HTML/CSS.
The Front-End was based off of a template from HTML5 UP that we used for our home page, then the other web application's pages were styled after the home page, and Israel connected the Front-End to the Back-End.
